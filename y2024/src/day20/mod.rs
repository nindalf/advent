/// Performance
/// Part 1 - 473Âµs, not much to do here.
/// Part 2 - 96.7ms initially. Optimised to 37.8ms (-61%) by replacing a HashSet with a simple counter and preventing double counting.
/// Alternate solution: store the path in a Vec, where the index is the distance from the beginning.
/// But it doesn't perform better for either part because the number of lookups is much higher. Cache-friendliness doesn't compensate for that.
/// The code is much cleaner though, so I kept it.
/// Part 1 with Vec takes 59.2ms (+12399% regression).
/// Part 2 with Vec is 59.4ms (+57 regression).
/// Coming back much later, I forgot the obvious one - rayon for part 2.
/// Improves performance by 84% from 39ms -> 6.2ms.
/// And another suggestion by maneatingape - you don't need to check all points, just a subset.
/// Improves performance by 27.4% from 6.2ms to 4.5ms.
