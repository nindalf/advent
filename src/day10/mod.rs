/// Note on performance: The const generic bool param makes no difference to part 1, because it it is enabled.
/// For part 2 it does make a 4.2% difference: 62.5µs -> 60.3µs. Marginal, but it shows that
/// const generics can make a difference if used correctly.
///
/// The other favourite trick is rayon, which works poorly here. Since both parts execute so quickly
/// the overhead of using rayon is greater than the benefits it provides.
/// With rayon enabled, part 1 is 245.35 µs (+187% regression) and part 2 is 209.35 µs (+235% regression).
///
/// The last trick is reducing re-allocations, which I'm unable to do here. Increasing the capacity of the
/// HashSet and VecDeque have no effect.
///
/// More optimal algo? No, vanilla BFS is definitely the way to go here
/// More optimal data structures? Can't get better than HashSet and VecDeque for vanilla BFS.
